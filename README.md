### Hi there 👋

🤵 I'm 25, married, living in Salvador (Brazil). I am passionate about coding, playing musical instruments, tv shows, movies, good books, and good coffee. I'm a nerd but I'm also a husband, musician, athlete, self-learner, and extremely resilient.  

🏭 I have more than 3 years of work experience testing software applications. I have experience with manual and automated testing using BDD. I have experience with black-box testing, regression testing, performance testing, API testing, database testing, front-end testing, and mock testing. I have experience writing test cases and test planning. I have experience monitoring CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.  

⭐ I have work experience with Java, Ruby (RSpec, Capybara), Cucumber, Postman, Selenium, Jenkins, Docker, Mountebank, SoapUI, Apache JMeter, Oracle DB, and PL/SQL. I have study experience with JavaScript, Cypress, Jest, Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HTML5, CSS3, React.js, React Native, C/C++, and Python.
